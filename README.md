The development of a decentralized file storage application utilizing IPFS and Ethereum blockchain technology 
represents a significant advancement in decentralized computing. Through the integration of key technologies 
such as React, CSS, JavaScript, IPFS, Ganache, Truffle, Ethereum, Solidity, smart contracts, and Node.js, we have 
successfully created a robust platform that addresses the limitations of centralized file storage systems.
The installation and configuration of IPFS provided a decentralized storage protocol, ensuring data availability 
and redundancy across a distributed network of nodes. Smart contract development using Solidity facilitated the 
implementation of file storage logic and access control mechanisms, ensuring secure and transparent interactions 
within the decentralized application.
The utilization of Truffle for smart contract compilation and deployment with Ganache enabled seamless 
integration with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for efficient testing and deployment of smart contracts in a 
local development environment. Frontend development with React resulted in an intuitive user interface, enabling 
users to upload and retrieve files stored on IPFS with ease.
Integration of smart contracts and IPFS within the React application facilitated seamless communication and 
interaction between the frontend and backend components of the decentralized file storage application. Users 
could upload files to IPFS, trigger transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, and retrieve files stored on IPFS 
through a user-friendly interface.
In conclusion, the developed decentralized file storage application demonstrates the potential of blockchain and 
IPFS integration in addressing the challenges of centralized file storage systems. Moving forward, further 
enhancements and optimizations can be explored to enhance scalability, interoperability, and usability, paving the 
way for a more decentralized and resilient internet infrastructure.
